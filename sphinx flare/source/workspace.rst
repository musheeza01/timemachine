Workspace & Local Pipeline
****************************

Overview
================

Workspace allows you to create a space that can be used to group the pipelines within it. You can create a local pipeline or import a published pipeline within a workspace.

.. Note::
    It is mandatory to assign a pipeline to a workspace.

To access the workspaces section, select **Workspaces & Local Pipelines** from the main menu. 
The workspaces page will appear on the screen.
