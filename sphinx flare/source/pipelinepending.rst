Test Pipeline
=======================

LigaData Flare provides the ability to test your local pipelines directly from the workspace or from the pipelines pending approval page. Doing so, allows you to verify if the pipeline is running as expected and anything that might be offtrack can be identified immediately.

To put a pending pipeline to test, follow the steps below:

1. Click on the **Test** button under the **Actions** column, corresponding to the pipeline to be tested. A dialog box will appear on the screen.

2. Configure the following values for testing:

    a. **Version:** Select the pipeline version

    b. **Environment:** Select the staging environment in which the pipeline needs to be tested. This is a critical step as it will define the connections, caches and the parameters that the pipeline can utilize.

3. Once done, hit the **Deploy** button.
The pipeline will be moved to the Pipelines in Testing page.
