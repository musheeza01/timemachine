<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>A Pipeline within LigaData Flare provides a visual representation of data flow passing through multiple steps and processes from data sources to destination systems.</p>
<p>It offers an end-to-end pipeline management capability that allows you to define how data should be processed at each stage and configure the settings for each origin, processor and destination node. Data pipelines can also make decisions or update states of system entities based on incoming data.</p>
<p>The image below shows the lifecycle of a typical pipeline created on LigaData Flare along with the various possible use cases.</p>

<p>All pipelines are associated with a workspace. Hence, it is mandatory to create a workspace before creating a pipeline. For more information, refer to the <ac:link ac:anchor="Workspace&amp;LocalPipeline">
