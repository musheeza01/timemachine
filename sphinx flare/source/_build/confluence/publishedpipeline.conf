<h2>Deploy Pipeline</h2>
<p>To deploy a published pipeline, follow the steps below:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li style="margin-top: 10px;">
<p>Click on the <strong>Deploy</strong> button under the <strong>Actions</strong> column, corresponding to the pipeline to be tested. A dialog box will appear on the screen.</p>
</li>
<li style="margin-top: 10px;">
<p>Configure the following values for testing:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 30px;padding-top: 10px;">
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> Select the pipeline version to be deployed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Environment:</strong> Select the production environment in which the pipeline needs to be deployed. This is a critical step as it will define the connections, caches and the parameters that the pipeline can utilize.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<ac:structured-macro ac:name="info">
<ac:rich-text-body>
<p>If the selected environment has no parameters defined, then the parameters/values configures for the selected pipeline will take precedence.</p>
</ac:rich-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<p>3. Once done, hit the Deploy button. The pipeline will be added to the Deployed Pipelines page.</p>

<h2>View Pipeline History</h2>
<p>The history icon in Flare displays the list of pipeline versions that exist for the corresponding pipeline. Pipeline versions are created as a result of first, <strong>importing</strong> a certain pipeline and then <strong>publishing</strong> it once again. Repeating this process will result with an increment of the pipeline version.</p>
<p>To view the previous versions of a pipeline, follow the steps below:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>
<p>Click on the <strong>History</strong> icon under the <strong>Actions</strong> column, corresponding to the pipeline for which the version history needs to be viewed. The following page will appear on the screen with clickable version numbers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><ac:image ac:align="center">
<ri:attachment ri:filename="history.png"></ri:attachment>
</ac:image></p>
<div style="clear: both"> </div>
<p>2. Click on the version number that needs to be viewed. The pipeline designer view will appear on the screen displaying the pipeline structure and data flows in the selected version.</p>
<h2>Import Pipeline</h2>
<p>Using Flare, you can import the current or any previous version of the pipeline, back into the workspace.</p>
<ac:structured-macro ac:name="note">
<ac:rich-text-body>
<p>A previously imported pipeline cannot be reimported to the same workspace.</p>
</ac:rich-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<h3>Import Latest Version of Pipeline</h3>
<p>Under the <strong>Latest Version</strong> column, you’ll notice the number of versions of the pipelines where the latest will be considered when importing or duplicating it.</p>
<p>To import a pipeline, follow the steps below:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>
<p>Click on the <strong>Import</strong> button under the <strong>Actions</strong> column, corresponding to the pipeline to be imported. A dialog box will appear on the screen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the workspace from the dropdown, in which the pipeline needs to be imported.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>3. Click on the <strong>Import</strong> button to proceed. The pipeline will be successfully imported as a local pipeline with the same name in the selected workspace.</p>
<ac:structured-macro ac:name="info">
<ac:rich-text-body>
<p>If the imported pipeline is published, it will be done so as a <strong>new version</strong> of the original pipeline.</p>
</ac:rich-text-body>
</ac:structured-macro>
<h3>Import Previous Version of Pipeline</h3>
<p>To import a previous version of the pipeline, follow the steps below:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">

<p>3. Click on the <strong>Duplicate</strong> button to proceed. A copy of the pipeline will be created in the selected workspace as a local pipeline.</p>
<ac:structured-macro ac:name="info">
<ac:parameter ac:name="title">Info</ac:parameter>
<ac:parameter ac:name="icon">false</ac:parameter>
<ac:rich-text-body>
<p>The naming convention of the duplicate pipeline consists of the original name followed by <strong>_copy</strong> as a suffix.</p>
