Overview
============

LigaData Flare allows you to customize the text on your application and use your business-specific terminologies.

In this section, we will discuss the customization steps in detail.

LigaData Flare provides customization support for the following:

* Customization of error messages using :ref:`labels.properties <labels>`

* Customization of configuration fields for stages using :ref:`stages.properties <stages>`

* Customization of configuration fields for connections using :ref:`connections.properties <connections>`

* Customization of text displayed on the :ref:`Flare UI <ui>`

Executing the following command with the **-labels, -stages and -connections** flags followed by the path of the file, as shown below, will run the UI server with customized text as mentioned above:

.. code::

    java -Dlog4j.configurationFile=log4j2.xml -Dlogback.configurationFile=logback.xml -cp "FlareDISvc_2.12-0.01.00.jar" JettyLauncher -configFile=application.conf -keyWordsFile=keywords.csv -labels=labels.properties -stages=stages.properties -connections=connections.properties > /dev/null 2>&1 &

.. caution::

    * Please make sure that you provide the correct path of where your files with custom text, such as **labels.properties** is located
    * Running the above mentioned command without the **-labels, -stages and -connections** flags will signal the system to use the default messaging
